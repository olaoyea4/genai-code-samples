    "Conversational interfaces such as chatbots and virtual assistants can be used to enhance the user experience for your customers. Chatbots can be used in a variety of applications, such as customer service, sales, and e-commerce, to provide quick and efficient responses to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key technical detail which we need to include in our system to enable a chat feature is conversational memory. This way, customers can ask follow up questions and the LLM will understand what the customer has already said in the past. The image below shows how this is orchestrated at a high level.\n",

       "- Adjust decision thresholds for different groups to account for natural variance and achieve fair outcomes rather than just equal error rates. \n",

       "What kind of bias does SageMaker Clarify detect?,\" Measuring bias in ML models is a first step to mitigating bias. Bias may be measured before training and after training, as well as for inference for a deployed model. Each measure of bias corresponds to a different notion of fairness. Even considering simple notions of fairness leads to many different measures applicable in various contexts. You must choose bias notions and metrics that are valid for the application and the situation under investigation. SageMaker currently supports the computation of different bias metrics for training data (as part of SageMaker data preparation), for the trained model (as part of Amazon SageMaker Experiments), and for inference for a deployed model (as part of Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor). For example, before training, we provide metrics for checking whether the training data is representative (that is, whether one group is underrepresented) and whether there are differences in the label distribution across groups. After training or during deployment, metrics can be helpful to measure whether (and by how much) the performance of the model differs across groups. For example, start by comparing the error rates (how likely a model's prediction is to differ from the true label) or break further down into precision (how likely a positive prediction is to be correct) and recall (how likely the model will correctly label a positive example).\""

The returned distance score is L2 distance ( Squared Euclidean) . Therefore, a lower score is better. Further in FAISS we have similarity_search_with_score (ranked by distance: low to high) and similarity_search_with_relevance_scores ( ranked by relevance: high to low) with both using the distance strategy. The similarity_search_with_relevance_scores calculates the relevance score as 1 - score. For more details of the various distance scores [read here](https://milvus.io/docs/metric.md)\n"

    "\n",
    "Beyond the primitive classes for prompt handling and conversational memory management, LangChain also provides a framework for [orchestrating RAG flows](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/cookbook/retrieval) with what purpose built \"chains\". In this section, we will see how to be a retrieval chain with LangChain which is more comprehensive and robust than the original retrieval system we built above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow we used above follows the following process...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User input is received.\n",
    "2. User input is queried against the vector database to retrieve relevant documents.\n",
    "3. Relevant documents and chat memory are inserted into a new prompt to respond to the user input.\n",
    "4. Return to step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, more complex methods of interacting with the user input can generate more accurate results in RAG architectures. One of the popular mechanisms which can increase accuracy of these retrieval systems is utilizing more than one call to an LLM in order to reformat the user input for more effective search to your vector database. A better workflow is described below compared to the one we already built...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User input is received.\n",
    "2. An LLM is used to reword the user input to be a better search query for the vector database based on the chat history and other instructions. This could include things like condensing, rewording, addition of chat context, or stylistic changes.\n",
    "3. Reformatted user input is queried against the vector database to retrieve relevant documents.\n",
    "4. The reformatted user input and relevant documents are inserted into a new prompt in order to answer the user question.\n",
